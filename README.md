Google book API Android app project

## Getting Started

Simply clone the repository in your computer and run it using Android studio.

### Prerequisites

* Android studio 3.0
* Gradle 4.1
* Gradle plugin 3.0.0
* Emulator or phisical device (to be used for ISBN search by camera testing)

## Troubleshooting

* using an emulator with an Android SDK > API 21 may cause the emulator complaining about missing google play dependencies when going into the camera activity.
  * For best results use a phisical device. If you want to use the emulator downgrade to API 21. The camera activity will work if you have a webcam available on the computer.
